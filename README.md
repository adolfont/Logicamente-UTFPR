"Logicamente" is a system to help undergraduate students learn logic. It is a version of another system (see Section Original Logicamente). Runnable jars can be downloaded from http://github.com/adolfont/Logicamente-UTFPR/downloads.

The objective of this version of Logicamente is to help students to learn the syntax of propositional classical logic.

The student gives as input a formula and the system draws a parse tree for the formula (if the formula is syntactically correct).

This system is based in the "Tree Interaction" tab of the original Logicamente system.

# Original Logicamente

The original "Logicamente" system is available at http://www.dimap.ufrn.br/logicamente/.


# Project Information

The development of this system is an activity in the 2010 edition of the Agile Methods course at PPGCA - UTFPR.
