The objective of this system is to help students to learn the syntax of 
propositional classical logic.

The student gives as input a formula and the system draws a parse tree 
for the formula (if the formula is syntactically correct).


This system is based in the "Tree 
Interaction" tab of the Logicamente system: 
http://www.dimap.ufrn.br/logicamente/.

The only use case for this system can be seen in:
