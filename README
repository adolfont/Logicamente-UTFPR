The objective of this version of the system is to help students to learn the syntax of propositional classical logic.

The student gives as input a formula and the system draws a parse tree for the formula (if the formula is syntactically correct).

This system is based in the "Tree Interaction" tab of the Logicamente system:  http://www.dimap.ufrn.br/logicamente/.

The only use case for this system can be seen in:

The development of this system is an activity in the 2010 edition of the Agile Methods course (http://www.dainf.ct.utfpr.edu.br/wiki/index.php/Metodologias_%C3%81geis_para_o_Desenvolvimento_de_Software) at PPGCA.
